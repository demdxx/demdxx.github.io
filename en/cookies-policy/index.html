On our website, we use the following:</p><h3 id=according-to-the-entity-that-manages-it>ACCORDING TO THE ENTITY THAT MANAGES IT</h3><p><strong>First-party cookies:</strong></p><p>These are sent to the User&rsquo;s terminal equipment from a machine or domain managed by the publisher itself and from which the service requested by the User is provided.</p><p><strong>Third-party cookies:</strong></p><p>These are sent to the User&rsquo;s terminal equipment from a machine or domain that is not managed by the publisher, but by another entity that processes the data obtained through cookies.</p><p>If cookies are served from a machine or domain managed by the publisher itself, but the information collected through them is managed by a third party, they cannot be considered as first-party cookies if the third party uses them for its own purposes (for example, improving the services it provides or providing advertising services on behalf of other entities).</p><h3 id=according-to-its-purpose>ACCORDING TO ITS PURPOSE</h3><p><strong>Technical cookies:</strong></p><p>These are necessary for the navigation and proper functioning of our Website, such as controlling traffic and data communication, identifying the session, accessing restricted access parts, making the request for registration or participation in an event, counting visits for billing software licenses used by the Website&rsquo;s service, using security elements during navigation, storing content for the dissemination of videos or sound, enabling dynamic content (e.g., loading animation of text or image), or sharing content through social networks.</p><p><strong>Analytical cookies:</strong></p><p>These allow quantifying the number of users and thus carrying out the measurement and statistical analysis of the use made by users of the Website.</p><p><strong>Preference or customization cookies:</strong></p><p>These are those that allow remembering information so that the User accesses the service with certain characteristics that may differentiate their experience from that of other users, such as language, the number of results to show when the User performs a search, the appearance or content of the service depending on the type of browser through which the User accesses the service or the region from which the User accesses the service, etc.</p><h3 id=according-to-the-time-they-remain-activated>ACCORDING TO THE TIME THEY REMAIN ACTIVATED</h3><p><strong>Session cookies:</strong></p><p>These are designed to collect and store data while the User accesses a web page.</p><p>They are usually used to store information that is only of interest to keep for the provision of the service requested by the User on a single occasion (for example, a list of purchased products) and disappear when the session ends.</p><p><strong>Persistent cookies:</strong></p><p>These are those in which the data is still stored in the terminal and can be accessed and processed during a period defined by the person responsible for the cookie, which can range from a few minutes to several years. In this regard, it must be specifically assessed whether the use of persistent cookies is necessary, since the risks to privacy could be reduced through the use of session cookies. In any case, when persistent cookies are installed, it is recommended to minimize their temporary duration to the minimum necessary according to their purpose of use. For these purposes, Opinion 4/2012 of the WP29 indicated that for a cookie to be exempt from the duty of informed consent, its expiration must be related to its purpose. Therefore, session cookies are much more likely to be considered exempt than persistent cookies.</p></div><div class=split-lists><div class=split-list><h3>Social (contact)</h3><ul><li><a href=https://linkedin.com/in/demdxx/>Linkedin</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/demdxx>GitHub</a></li><li><a href=https://www.instagram.com/demdxx/>Instagram</a></li><li><a href=https://www.facebook.com/demdxx>Facebook</a></li></ul></div><div class=split-list><h3>Other</h3><ul><li><a href=/en/cookies-policy/>Cookies policy</a></li><li><a href=/en/privacy-policy/>Privacy policy</a></li><li><a href=/en/terms-of-conditions/>Terms of conditions</a></li></ul></div></div><div class=split-credit><p>&copy;2019 &ndash; 2024 Demdxx</p></div></div></div></div></body></html>
