<h2 id="manifesto">Manifesto</h2>
<p>My <a href="https://github.com/demdxx/manifest">manifest</a> which I wrote at first days of the war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Manifesto (addition, after more then year of war in Ukraine).</p>
<ul>
<li>Russians do not support Putin. They are forced to support him because of the lack of information and the fear of being imprisoned or killed.</li>
<li>European countries and the USA primarily struggle with regular Russian citizens who simply do not want to participate in the crimes of the dictatorial regime in Russia. Meanwhile, they admit the main instigators of the war, who are deputies and oligarchs closely tied to the Putin regime.</li>
<li>European officials, who very recently supported Putin, openly declared their affection for him and engaged in business dealings with him, helping to build the dictatorship, now hypocritically label Russians as terrorists. This double standard is a glaring example of their hypocrisy.</li>
<li>Russians are just like any other people, and they need assistance, not ostracism that confines them behind an iron curtain.</li>
