The actions that happen in Ukraine right now do not have any excuse, Russia is the aggressor.
I feel my-self so hopeless and endlessly empty.
I blame myself for not committing enough to my friends and family about our government.
I blame the governments of Europe and the USA for had not taken any action against
the closest accomplices of this war, although they knew about all
their sins, but they needed the bloody Russian money more. I blame the citizens
of Russia who do not want to take part in the government of the country,
leaving everything in the hands of criminals.
The endless feeling of shame will never leave me.

Since 2006 work as a Software Engineer. During that time I tried myself in different
fields of my profession like web development, highload projects, mobile and desktop applications.
I continue to self-improvement, trying to do what I truly love.
